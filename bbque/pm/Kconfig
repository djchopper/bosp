config BBQUE_PM
  bool "Enable Power Management"
  default n
  ---help---
  Build the BarbequeRTRM with support for Power Management (PM).
  When compiled with this option turned on, all the PM management
  facilities could be selectively enabled or disabled. Indeed, each
  module could provide PM related supports, e.g. the optimization
  policy could optimize for power budgeting or the GPU could expose
  a power and thermal monitor.

  If unsure say no, this will disable all the PM related features.
